## Problem Title
Digital Health Record Management System
## Problem Description
Background:
Develop a secure, interoperable, and scalable digital platform that allows for the creation, management, and sharing of electronic health records (EHR) accessible by authorized healthcare providers and patients across the nation. The system aims to improve healthcare delivery, reduce duplication of diagnostic tests, enhance clinical decision-making, and ensure continuity of care throughout a patientâ€™s life journey.
This system will serve as a centralized digital health ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with hospitals, clinics, diagnostic labs, pharmacies, and insurance providers. Through the use of standardized data formats and communication protocols, such as HL7 and FHIR, the platform will facilitate real-time exchange of medical information across diverse healthcare settings, regardless of location.

## Idea

1.To build a nationwide Digital Health Record Management System that securely centralizes patient health data, enabling seamless access and sharing among authorized healthcare providers and patients. 


2.The system will function as a digital backbone for the healthcare ecosystem, integrating hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies, and insurance providers into one interoperable platform. 


3.By empowering patients with ownership of their health data and equipping doctors with real-time access to comprehensive medical histories, the system will enhance treatment accuracy, reduce redundancy in diagnostics, support emergency care, and improve overall healthcare efficiency. 


4.The platform will ensure data security, consent-based access, and compliance with privacy regulations, promoting a more transparent, patient-centric, and data-driven healthcare infrastructure.
